# User Query
"System: Please continue."

# Technical Deep Dive
## Session State Transition
The "Setup & Configuration" phase appears complete.
1.  **Context:** `gemini.md` created and customized.
2.  **Security:** Read-Only permissions on `~/dev` (except CWD) enforced.
3.  **Validation:** Permission scope verified and documented.

## Next Phase: Execution or Knowledge Building
Since no `08_*` file exists in the sequence, the session is now open-ended.
Potential directions based on project structure:
*   **Memory Architecture:** Deep dive into how `save_memory` interacts with context windows (`03_memory...`, `04_memory...`).
*   **Extension Analysis:** Exploring the `screenshare` or `vision` capabilities mentioned in the context.
*   **Gemini 3:** Analyzing the `gemini_3_comparison.md` file.

# Tool Usage
*   `glob`: Checked for the existence of `08*` files to determine if there was a predefined next step. Result: Negative.
