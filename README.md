# Dev Workspace Monorepo

This is the central repository for my personal development projects, automation tools, and documentation. It consolidates multiple previous repositories into a single, unified codebase.

## 📂 Project Directory

## 🛡️ Security & Governance

This workspace operates under a strict **Defense-in-Depth** security model.

*   **Policy:** All agents must adhere to [AI_SECURITY_POLICY.md](registry/docs/protocol/AI_SECURITY_POLICY.md).
*   **Standards:** Documentation standards are defined in [AI_DOCS_STANDARD.md](registry/docs/protocol/AI_DOCS_STANDARD.md).
