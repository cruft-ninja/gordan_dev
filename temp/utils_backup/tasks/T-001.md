# 🎯 Purpose
Create a small, standalone bash script (<20 lines) to address a specific utility need, ensuring it adheres to project conventions (executable, proper header).

# 📋 Requirements
- [x] **Script Name:** `xdg_urls`
- [x] **Functionality:**
    - [x] Accept variable number of URLs as command-line arguments.
    - [x] If no arguments provided, prompt the user to enter them.
    - [x] Concatenate the URLs into a single formatted string (space-separated).
    - [x] Call `xdg-open` with the formatted string.
- [x] **Constraint:** Code must be concise (approx. <20 lines).
- [x] **Style:** Include concise comments (header + logic).
- [x] **Output:** Script must be located in `bash/` and **NOT** be executable (sourced only).

# 🏗️ Technical Context
- **Affected Projects:** `utils`
- **Relevant Files:** `bash/` directory.
- **Dependencies:** Standard bash environment.

# 🛠️ Proposed Implementation
1. Receive script name and logic from user.
2. Create file in `bash/` with `#!/bin/bash` shebang.
3. Implement logic using `google-chrome-stable`.
4. Ensure script is NOT executable (sourced usage).

# 📝 Execution Notes
- User requested `google-chrome-stable` instead of `xdg-open`.
- User requested script to remain non-executable for sourcing.

# ✅ Completion Criteria
- Script exists in `bash/`.
- Script is not executable (`chmod -x`).
- Script sources correctly and launches Chrome.
