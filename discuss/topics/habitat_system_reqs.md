# Habitat System Requirements

**Date:** 2026-01-14
**Status:** Open

## Context
Habitat is currently being evaluated for migration to a dedicated local server to improve performance and isolation.

## Scope
<!-- General scope of the discussion. -->

## Goals / Questions
Determine the hardware and software specifications required to host Habitat reliably on a dedicated local server.

## Ideas / Notes
### Current Static Footprint (2026-01-29)
*   **Total Disk Usage:** 65MB
*   **File Count:** ~614 files
*   **Large Assets:** None > 100MB detected.
*   **Implication:** Storage needs are minimal for the codebase itself. Focus requirements on runtime performance (Docker, LLM inference) rather than raw storage.

<!-- Brainstorming area. -->

## Action Items / Decisions
- [ ] <!-- Trackable outcome 1 -->
- [ ] <!-- Trackable outcome 2 -->

> **Guideline:** Update this file *during* the discussion as decisions are made, rather than waiting until the end. This helps keep the context active and prevents "drift".
