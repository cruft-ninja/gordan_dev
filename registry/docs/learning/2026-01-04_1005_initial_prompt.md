no thanks. please output your latest response to a file. My main interest for this session, is to get an overview of how gemini operates locally, i.e what files it uses for configuration, context, etc. it would be a great help if you output both my prompts and your replies to files. you can name them as you see fit, maybe just number them sequentially or some similar simple naming scheme. i will relocate them and use for later reference. You are a great teacher.
