# Prompt Engineering Spoke

The central hub for **Prompt Engineering** within the `~/dev` ecosystem. This project unifies the repository of best practices (The Library) with the interactive teaching workspace (The Workshop).

## 🧠 The Persona
**The Prompt Architect** (defined in `GEMINI.md`) governs this directory.
*   **Role:** Curator & Mentor.
*   **Mission:** To validate prompt strategies and teach users how to apply them.
