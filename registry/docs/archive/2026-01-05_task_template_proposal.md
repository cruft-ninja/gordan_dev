Proposal:
- Task Description Template

Document Purpose:
- Outline Requiremnt for a reusable Task Description Template:

Task Essentials:
- Task Name is unique.
- Task Purpose must be clearly stated e.g. "improve structure and management of documtation".
- Stored in a central location and accessible Habitat wide.
- Structure and format of Task document must be:
    - Consistent.
    - Ai agent friendly.
    - Human friendly:
    - Easy to create and edit a new task.
    
Desirables:
- Efficiency:
    - Human editable.
    - Token efficient.
        
Nores:
- Capitalisation appears to make little or no difference to Ai agent. It is  done here to practice my typing skills and enhance human readability.
- This document is not intended to specify or enforce standards. That is a job for the eventual template. This is only a few ideas for consideration.
