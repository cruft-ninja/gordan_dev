  Welcome, Management. You are currently standing in the root of the `~/dev` Ecosystem, a structured
  development environment designed for autonomous agent collaboration, rigorous documentation, and
  toolchain automation.

  Here is the strategic layout of your habitat:

  1. The Command Center (Root)
   * Location: ~/dev
   * Function: Central nervous system. I resides here to enforce security (AI_SECURITY_POLICY.md), ensure
     architectural coherence, and facilitate communication between sub-agents.

  2. Active Operations (Projects)
  We have four specialized divisions currently online:
   * `cli_bootstrap_tools/`: The Gnarly Workflow Encabulator. Responsible for environment scaffolding, uv
     dependency management, and reproducible setups.
   * `task_runner_gui/`: The Script Runner. A Python/Tkinter GUI bridge that turns raw Bash scripts into
     user-friendly interactive tools.
   * `prompt_engineering/`: The Prompt Architect. A library and workshop for crafting high-fidelity LLM
     prompts.
   * `docs_gemini_internals/`: The Technical Writer. Dedicated to introspective documentation and logging
     the evolution of this very system.

  3. The Knowledge Base (Registry)
   * Location: registry/
   * Function: The single source of truth.
       * `docs/protocol/`: Immutable laws (Security Policy, Docs Standards).
       * `docs/learning/`: A chronological history of lessons learned and architectural decisions.
       * `tasks/`: Centralized task tracking (currently tracking T-002).

  4. Tactical Support (Utils)
   * Location: utils/
   * Function: A utility belt of raw Bash scripts for system monitoring (check_cpu.sh, disk_monitor.sh)
     and maintenance (backup_dir.sh, fix_perms.sh).

  Summary: The habitat is structured, protocol-compliant, and ready for instruction. How shall we
  proceed?
