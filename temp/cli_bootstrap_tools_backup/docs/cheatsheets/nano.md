# Nano Cheatsheet (Simple Text Editor)

Nano is a basic terminal text editor. It's great for quick edits.

## 1. Basics
| Command | What it does |
| :--- | :--- |
| `nano <file>` | Opens a file for editing. |

## 2. Shortcuts (Ctrl Keys)
Nano uses `Ctrl` (represented as `^`) for commands. The shortcuts are listed at the bottom of the screen.

| Shortcut | Action | Note |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `Ctrl + O` | **Write Out (Save)** | You will be asked to confirm the filename. Press Enter. |
| `Ctrl + X` | **Exit** | If you have unsaved changes, it will ask "Save modified buffer?". Press `Y` for Yes, then Enter. |
| `Ctrl + W` | **Where Is (Search)** | Type your search term and hit Enter. |
| `Ctrl + K` | **Cut Text** | Cuts (deletes) the current line. |
| `Ctrl + U` | **Uncut Text** | Pastes the line you just cut. |

## 3. Navigation
- Use **Arrow Keys** to move around.
- Mouse clicks usually don't work for moving the cursor in standard Nano.
